      <p>Accustomed to being around primarily adults. I was always mature for my age. Even my own friends often annoyed me during my adolecent years. I had a lot of people who invested in me, and I excelled at most of my many and varied hobbies. My name is Sushant Raman Pokharel. I grew up an only child. When I was young,my understanding of events and people was simple: things were good or bad. This made it easier to deal with the world around me. Then, when I became a young man, things seem far more complicated, and instead of black and white I saw grays everywhere I looked.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> This made life densed with motive and decision, and more challenging to navigate. Now, as a man in a adult phase, I find that my view of the world is redusing itself to the simple again. I naturally break complex things down into small pieces so I can explain them. And far from oversimplifying, I find this brings me back to the hand full of important basics of being alive. I believe in respect. Because without respect there's no caring; and without caring, life is harsh wasteland. Without respect we are all enimies, with just occasional beast to a friend.
       Talking bout', the hip-hop, it's a culture that knows no geographical or cultural boundries. It has developed as a lifestyle, enriching the world with its uniqueness. Being ambitious is one thing, having realistic goals is another.Rap has become not just a music for me now it carries a vibe of cultural and religious values that has completely attached with my soul.
        As we know art has no boundries, any artist can get attached to any shot of art formed with the change in time. I did got attached to the photography world. Photography for me is not looking , its feeling; if you can't feel what you're looking at , then you're never going to get others to feel anything when they look at your pictures. To me , photography is an art of observation. It's about finding something interesting in an ordinary place. It's about reacting what you see, hopefully without preconception. You can find pictures anywhere. It's simply a matter of noticing things and organizing them. You don't take a photograph, you make it. It's a result of hardwork and dedication, there is no any shortcuts for it.</p>
